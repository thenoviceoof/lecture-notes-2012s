Lecture Notes
Spring 2012

It's really strange: computers are ubiquitous, yet we 90+% of my
fellow students still take notes with pencil and paper. Personally, I
can type much faster than I can write by hand: why do we not take
notes with computers, where copy pasting steps of a proof is easy and
you can grep through your notes?

This is also a reaction against myself, for not having finished the
Notesoble project yet, which would have made this effort
redundant. I'll get around to it sometime.

All notes are taken at 80col width, LaTeX-like syntax, and
headings/dividers wherever I damn please. Also, I will swear and do
random things. You have been forewarned.
