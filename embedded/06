Lab #2 out, should be all set up

Talking about PS/2
  yup, PS/2 is obsolete, but w/e
  lol, keyboard part of the computer
  ha, 10A through each pin?? (older connector, DIN-5)
  DIN is a german standard

PS/2 is synch interface (like RS-232, but w/ a clock??)
  oh, this format looks familiar
  interface is completely random, wth?
  probably can ignore key-up messages
  note extended code stuff for arrow keys
    6B -> E06B (keypad -> arrow keys)

mouse?
  computer has to init comms with PS/2 mouse
  sounds kind of like I2C, except not really
  for host->keyboard [LED control, echo, ... etc]
  back to mouse - enable data reporting (0xF4), get 3 byte "packets" back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
talking about C stuff

software tends to stick around much longer than intended/wanted

talking about low-level C desiderata

PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL

talking about floating point in software/hardware
avoid division, pretty much avoid everything
do bit-manipulation instead!

rightmost 1 bit? fancy bit manip
 b = a & (a ^ (a-1));
 can't do it leftmost, relies on carrying pattern from subtraction

and now showing how to do popcount (count 1's in a bit array)

if multiplying by constant, then can go faster (+/<<)
  new: try subtraction, if that gets you fewer additions

stopping here
