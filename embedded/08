Got here early (wth)

Talking about Software/Hardware interface

processor linked to address/data busses
  DE2 world: called the Avalon bus
  bunch of different busses for different things

Bus timings:
  R/W
  Enable (when addr is good)
  Addr
  Data (read, or write)

strobe vs. handshake
strobe
  ping, ack is data
handshake
  send ack when you've read the data

quote: she was, in many ways, a protocol failure

talking about the ISA bus
 - somehow got standardized
 - various signal names
   BALE - address latch enable
   MEMR - memory read
   IOCHRDY - I/O channel ready
 - and you can get ISA boards!

reviewing memory-mapped I/O

also, lab 3 is going to be coding a processor (?) on the bare metal

PC parallel port
 - derp
 - have a parallel port? still have the 3 bytes of memory linked
 - oh, and we coded it
   looking at a card's schematics

oh, it's just video controller or FM audio for lab #3

talking about interrupts
 - la la la
 - also, prioritize the interrupts (if 2 at the same time)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Video

talking about how CRTs work

I admit, my notes are useless. derp
