================================================================================
Note: no lectures next week

Talking about VHDL
 - history
   - used to be a bunch of guys drawing transistors and wires
   - 1970: mention SPICE, transistor-level netlists (analog logic)
     - oh god punch cards (SPICE deck)
   - 1980: graphical schematic capture programs
   - 1990: HDLs, logic synthesis
     - generate the schematics, etc
 - talking about verilog/VHDL battle
   - semantically identical, synth parts using either
   - talking about syntax of VHDL

Talking about modeling styles of VHDL (review)
 - remember: true/false are characters (enumerated)
 - talking about std_logic_1164
 - module
   - process blocks
   - dataflow expressions
   - components
 - entity/architecture pairs
   - no one ever uses more than one arch for one entity
 - altera/xilinx
   - both are great, using altera
 - bit collections
   - std_logic_vector (ieee_std_1164)
   - unsigned/signed (numeric_std) [use ieee.numeric_std.all;]
 - use little endian for vectors (by decree of edwards)
   - [unsigned(i downto 0)]
 - question about indexing into vector (dynamic?)
   - multiplexer?
   - or maybe just a wire?
   - point: know how your code translates to hardware
 - negative numbers: two's complement

kind of fell asleep for a bit

 - case statement from with/when, do use a decoder or ROM
   - can figure out the k-map
 - going to end up trying to get these things correct, not efficient
 - talking about with/select
 - & -> vector concatenation
 - don't try to just pick up VHDL code and modify it for your own use
   - it will be very difficult
   - easier to just re-implement
