came in 30 minutes late

talking about doing dynamic memory allocation
  it's like we're back in OS all over again!
  endorsing the simple linked list

seems like we talked about various math optimizations/array accesses

allocation/deallocation is pretty volatile in time

huh, talking about memory-mapped I/O
 - it does whatever it wants
 - example, reading memory mapping of switches, feeding them to LED memory
 - Note: volatile keyword skips the cache, good for memory-mapped stuff

talking about interrupts
  lalalala

talking about debugging
  UR A N00B
