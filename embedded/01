Embedded Systems
W4840(?)
================================================================================

cars are computers with strange peripherals

talking about desiderata of embedded systems
 - price
 - performance
 - power
 - etc

talking about moore's law

referrenced kurzweil

interesting: trying to get us to think in a 'just work' mentality
 - guess it makes sense, it is an embedded course

EWOG?

goal of good engineering - can hide stuff

oh god debugging/detailed design major time sinks

if you can't see the cat, the sucker's dead

yay FPGAs

Apple ][ on the dev board

class
 - take board
 - do something with it
 - more detail:
   - 3 intro labs (learn dev software)
     - intro VHDL
     - ethernet
     - FM audio or video bouncing ball
   - project: design your own
     - 4 each
     - C + VHDL + peripherals
     - don't worry too much about being original

please drop the course! :P

main challenges
 - real sensor data
   - correcting CCD data
     - correct for supurious pixels, periodic, bias
     - convert to color, correct color temp/exposure
 - algo design
   - get some data
   - prototype the algo
   - figure out how to implement
   - implement with fuckton of testing
 - implementation details
