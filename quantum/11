reminder: oh god there is a quiz
  most of them are 1-liners, so don't carry the damn library
  don't write essays
  he's expecting binary results

review

U, 1 qubit gate
implemented
 - C^n(U)  // n control qubits
 - Q(U), 1 control qubit, and k target qubits with U applied
 - 2-level gates
   huh, they're I with a random submatrix in the middle(?)
   U = QR  // all unitary, R is diagonal (?)
   at least understand the idea of decomposition
 - Any unit matrix can repr using [1-qubit gates, CNOT]
 - Any unitary matrix, can approximate with arbitrary accuracy using
   [H, S, T, CNOT]

Measurements
Measure state |\phi> using a collection of measurement operators
  {M_j, j=0..k-1} such that I = \sum M_j^H M_j
We get outcome j w/ prob
   p_{|\phi>}(j) = <\phi| M_j^H M_j |\phi> = || M_j |\phi> ||^2
   and \phi collapses to
   M_j(\phi)/p(j) = M_j |\phi> / || M_j |\phi> || // (unit state)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stop review

 - M_j are NOT arbitrary
   remember:
     I = \sum M_j^H M_j
   so
     1 = <\phi|I|\phi> = \sum <\phi| M_j^H M_j |\phi> = \sum p_{|\phi>}(j)
 - which means that {M_j} is also consistent
 - p_{|\phi>}(j) depends on j and |\phi>

example:
projective measurements (on computational basis)
  M_j = |j><j| for j\in {0, 2^n-1}  // 1 in the j+1 row/col
  M_j^H = M_j
  M_j^H M_j = |j><j|j><j| = |j><j| = M_j
  then:
  \sum M_j^H M_j = I
p_{|\phi>}(j) = <\phi| M_j^H M_j |\phi> = <\phi|j><j|\phi>
  = \bar{<j|\phi>}<j|\phi> = |<j|\phi>|^2
  note:
  |\phi> = \sum C_k|k> where C_j = <\phi|j>
  then, it's a projection:
  M_j |\phi> = |j><j|\phi> = <j|\phi> |j>
|\phi> collapses to M_j|\phi>/\sqrt{p(j)} = |j><j|\phi>/||<j|\phi>||
  = <j|\phi>/||<j|\phi>|| |j>
  // note: <j|\phi>/||<j|\phi>|| is the global phase
now, let's walk through a measurement
  |\phi> = a|0> = b|1>
  p_{|\phi>}(0) = ||<0|\phi>||^2 = || a<0|0> + b<0|1> ||^2 = ||a||^2
  let M_i = |i><i|
  Collapse of 0 leads to:
    M_0(\phi)/\sqrt{p(0)} = |0><0|\phi>/|a| = a/|a| |0>
    so a/|a| is global phase

Now, let's switch basis:
Measurement operators?
M_+ = |+><+|, M_- = |-><-|
  it's a complete set (\sum M_j = I), because + and - are orthonormal
|\phi> = a|0> + b|1>
  p_{|\phi>}(+) = <\phi| M_+^H M_+ |\phi> = <\phi|+><+|+><+|\phi>
  = <\phi|+><+|\phi> = ||<+|\phi>||^2
<+|\phi> = (<0|+<1|)/\sqrt{2} (a|0>+b|1>) = (a + b)/\sqrt{2}
<-|\phi> = ... = (a - b)/\sqrt{2}
So |\phi> collapses to (a+b)/||a+b|| |+> when measuring +
          collapses to (a-b)/||a-b|| |-> when measuring -

And another example:
n bits, k bits to measure
PAGE 9, FIGURE 1: illustrating the system
  measures in the computational of the k qubits
  M_j = I \tensor |j><j|, for j\in {0..2^k-1}
okay, so let's break up the |\psi> = |\psi_1>|\psi_2> corresponding to n and k
  p(j)|\psi> = ||M_j|\psi>||^2 = ||M_j
  = ||(I \tensor |j><j|)|\psi_1>|\psi_2> ||^2
  = ||(|\psi_1>)/normalize (|j><j|\psi_2> / normalize) ||^2
  = || <j|\psi_2> ||^2
  // use this in programming part of hw 2
then measurement is
  M_j|\psi>/\sqrt{p(j)} = <j|\psi_2>|\psi_1>|j> / ||<j|\psi_2>||


NOTE: these notes are suspect, I'm kind of thirsty
We can distinguish |\psi_1> != |\psi_2> with certainty (using
  measurements) only if |\psi_1> ortho |\psi_2>
We want M_1, M_2
  p_{|\phi_1}(1) = || M_1|\phi_1> ||^2 = 1
  and for 2
Can we show whether we can prove this? (not starting with the construction right
    away)
  I = M_1^H M_1 + M_2^H M_2 + M_3^H M_3  // M_3 might not be necessary
  1 = <\phi_1|I|\phi_1>
    = <\phi_1| M_1^H M_1 + M_2^H M_2 + M_3^H M_3 |\phi_1>
|\phi_1> = a|\psi_2> + b|Z>  // where Z \ortho |\phi_2>
  1 = |a|^2 + |b|^2  // a and b != 0
    then |\psi_1> \not\ortho |\psi_2>
  if a == 0 and b == 1
  M_1|\psi_1> = a M_j|\psi_2> + b M_1|Z>
  || M_1|\psi_1> || = b^2 || M_1|Z> ||^2
1 = |b|^2 <Z|M_1^M_1|Z>
  \leq |b|^2 <Z|(\sum M_i^H M_i)|Z> = |b|^2  < 1
  CONTRADICTION (somehow)
TRY THIS constructive proof, optional
  find M_1, M_2
